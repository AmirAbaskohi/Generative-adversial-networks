# Generative adversial networks
This is my answers to computer programming assignments of Coursera's Generative adversial networks (GANs) specialization.

## GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs. 

Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more. 

## Specialization
The DeepLearning.AI Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach. It also covers social implications, including bias in ML and the ways to detect it, privacy preservation, and more.

Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs.
